They will benefit from remote mentoring from a newly formed Curatorial Advisory Committee, a leading group of academics and curators who will push the curator’s ideas and proposals to their furthest potential. These mentors for 2018-2019 are: Nancy Adajania (Mumbai-based cultural theorist and co-curator of 9th Gwangju Biennial), Anne Barlow (Director, Tate St. Ives), Iftikhar Dadi (Associate Professor, Department of History of Art, Cornell University), Sebastian Cichoki (Chief Curator, Warsaw Museum of Modern Art), Catherine Morris (Senior Curator for the Elizabeth A.

In the scenes that follow, a macaque monkey &mdash; trained as a waitress and wearing the mask of a young woman &mdash; appears alone in an empty Japanese restaurant. Waiting amid the dystopian setting for her moment to perform, the monkey seems trapped within her defunct routine, forced to enact the human condition.</p>', '<p><strong>Pierre Huyghe</strong> (born 1962, Paris) is a major figure in the international contemporary art scene. Taking the exhibition and its ritual as an object, he works to change the paradigms of this encounter by exploring the dynamic possibilities embedded within it. He constructs time-based situations, self-generating networks, and living systems that exist according to their own rhythms and are indifferent to our presence. Since the mid-1980s, he has researched the architecture of the incomplete, directed a puppet opera, founded a temporary school, established a pirate television station, staged celebrations, scripted scenarios, made films, produced biotopes, bought the rights to a cartoon character, and journeyed to Antarctica in search of a mythical penguin.

It draws its lineage from an unwritten history of artist exchanges and reinserts the age-old system of barter into our present day context.</p>', '<p>The process, which Hemali Bhuta and Shreyas Karle of CONA have engaged in over time with artist friends, is being brought into a broader and public frame through an exhibition called Len Den (or give and take). In the months leading up to the opening, a group of artists were invited into a temporarily &lsquo;closed system&rsquo;, to undertake a series of negotiations towards trading what they make. Some of these engagements have resulted in new productions. The bartered works will first stopover at the exhibition space, where they will be available, sometimes stacked, sometimes on display, and Mumbai Art Room will stage itself as a ground for further exchanges. During the course of this period, each artist will invite five others to partake in a second round of the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having turned into an archival and storage room, the exhibition space reveals various aspects of the project&rsquo;s proceedings. The viewer encounters a zone of confidentiality in which art works are usually traded. Files for each artist, as well as for each barter, including images and notations, are being prepared. A collective contract that sits alongside the idea of individual ownership is being formulated. A selection from the corpus of dialogues around the project will be compiled into a publication with other texts. Divorced from the aura in which they typically appear in public, the artworks come forth as real things, objects in an assembly line of meaning. They sidestep the economy of the art market but enter a collection, raising questions about the value of art and its system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Mahesh Baliga, Hemali Bhuta, Makarand Dhotre, Jason Dodge, Bhuvanesh Gowda, Shreyas Karle, Ritesh Meshram, Yamini Nayar, Gyan Panchal, Himanshu S., Amitesh Shrivastava, Gagan Singh, Kiran Subbaiah, Sashikant Thavudoz and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>CONA Foundation</strong> is an artist-run space initiated in 2012 by Hemali Bhuta and Shreyas Karle. It emerged from a shared studio in Borivali, where a group of artists and designers felt the need to lay a ground for discourse around each other&rsquo;s practices in an adda or salon-like situation. CONA, as the name suggests, is situated at the corner or edge of the city, where it operates as a parallel pedagogical and residency structure that aims to dissolve the hierarchies between art and design, and acts as a bridge between the vernacular and the sophisticated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Special thanks to Kala Ghoda Caf&eacute;.</p>', '', 'N', 'exhibition', '518890306-03_11_2015_09_36_37-1446523597.jpg', '', '', '421791749-03_11_2015_09_36_37-1446523597.jpg', '', '', '161093089-03_11_2015_09_36_37-1446523597.jpg', '', '', '905517141-03_11_2015_09_36_37-1446523597.jpg', '', '', '778207992-03_11_2015_09_36_37-1446523597.jpg', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 1, '<p>PROJECT<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mumbaiartroom.org/projects.php?id=42\">Bartered Collections</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DOWNLOAD<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mumbaiartroom.org/publications.php?id=1\">Handouts</a></p>', NULL, 'published', '2015-09-15 18:08:12', '2015-11-04 09:29:01'),

She once studied the behaviour of bonnet macaques as part of a school project. She has also been a performer. The experience of performing has made her interested in the formal and sensorial qualities of Untitled (Human Mask). The film appears to constantly draw attention to the fact that it is staged, and is suffused with context, despite only making brief gestures to Fukushima and the monkey&#39;s personal biography. Is the monkey doing as monkeys do? What is the monkey&#39;s role in this moment? Is the monkey with agency? Is the monkey without? This thin line between the fictive and real that holds the nineteen minutes of the film together opens up a series of questions about how we can really know where that monkey fits in. Kavya will explore these thoughts through a close reading of her own responses to the film, and by looking at the monkey as an actor.</p>', '<p><strong>Prajna Desai </strong>is an art historian and writer, who is particularly interested in the narrative integrity of political and social statements in contemporary art. Does political and humanist activism do the issues more good than they do the artists? With respect to Untitled (Human Mask) her concern is also personal. She lived in Japan during the period of the 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear meltdown. Beyond the film&rsquo;s immediate narrative content &ndash; the psychological slippage between the stage-managed monkey and its subtle humanity and its relationship to the discourse of the Anthropocene &ndash; the film also points up an ethical dimension about the formal relationship between units of a montage. There&#39;s a quasi-political conversation about some loose rapport between Fukushima (catastrophe and disaster) and the monkey act (post-humanism) that the film throws up but never tackles head on.

This inward accounting of cheque amounts&nbsp;between different banks, is a process of verification that money has left an account, an acknowledgement of a transaction. Happening a few days after the event, this small printed sentence &lsquo;Inward clearing&rsquo; has the capacity to raise within us a brief wondering and recall, a tensile reckoning that the transaction has indeed taken place with our knowing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The artist perhaps puts into focus - framed by the sharp analytic lens of a cool white cube gallery, amidst the busy-eventful heat of a chaotic Bombay market - the artistic journey itself: how an artist goes through a process of recalling, re-joining the dots of a work a second time,&nbsp;verifying its value,&nbsp;before the work can have currency in the public realm. Here we find an exhibition talking about the brink, the self-conscious verification in the art process. And it is fascinating, with the quality of discovery; of objects under sand, of walking on the beach, conscious of our location in a city itself at sea. &nbsp;</p>', '<p>To call this a non-referential exhibition would not be accurate, as these processes can and do relate to the world outside, to fears connected with security, and to surveillance, to the banking system and its loopholes and scams, but they relate also to a world internal to its own grammar, where art looks inward to its own language.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Justin Ponmany is the artist whose work, while seemingly referential, straying away from pure conceptualism, or minimalism, most takes up the exploration of art languages themselves, in plural, as the central connection between all his work, from the exploratory experiments he made with photocopy machines in the defining period of the early 1990s at Sir JJ School of Art, to his experimentation with the special silvery inks used in security holograms which he used in paintings, to comic graphic language transferred to three-dimension, to the present exhibition with its linking of the world of banking, the graphics of security, with the history of art movements, of Vorticism and dazzle paintings, that preceded the First World War and were used on war ships, submarines, later appearing on textile as army uniforms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The security hologram acts as an antidote to easy counterfeiting through photocopying. Another aspect of the exhibition, returns to the photocopier and hologram, using the Xerox machine to &#39;blow up&rsquo;, to enlarge a hologram found on credit cards, but charging the process with the mystery and suspense of Antonioni&rsquo;s film of the same name. It is also a relevant comparison, when the photocopier is no longer used for this purpose. Yet, were one were to zoom into a given image digitally over photo-shop, the image at a certain point can enlarge no further, reaching a stage of pixelated abstract coloured squares. On the other hand, the photocopier can continue to enlarge an image till the machine starts to find its own patterns, making a portrait of itself, able to continue as if to infinity, unless somehow leashed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the artist presents with each exhibition and work, a discovery, what accompanies the work is a rare form of generosity, of an opening, a clearing in an inward forest of signs. Things might exist, ultimately going to the outside world, but are preceded by a security check, a kind of internal awareness and self-consiousness, before dispersing a value, useful and usable outside.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ponmany brings into view in this exhibition, several art languages, but most vividly, one historically tied to the art forms of the city - the making of elaborate ritualised rangoli. Among the practitioners is an expert, making idol images on the ground, refined over the last 46 years, on which visitors would generally leave coins for the gods. This folk form has a rare concentration within a room that is so square, it even parodies Doherty&rsquo;s white cube.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Zasha Colah</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The artist and Mumbai Art Room would like to thank:&nbsp;Ajit Shirke, Sandeep Jathari, Shkhar, rangoli artists; Janek Simon and Amol Patil.</p>', '', 'N', 'exhibition', '744830898-13_10_2015_22_14_54-1444754694.jpg', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 3, 1, '', '1', 'published', '2015-10-13 22:14:53', '2015-10-13 22:25:08'),

It also allowed the removal of entire villages to another area for any length of time.&nbsp;In the middle of the afternoon where children are playing, a uniformed man can&nbsp;trample over her garden, to torture, rape and murder a young woman. This man will never stand trial, and will&nbsp;never face a sentence.&nbsp;Immunity turns into state terror, and is proportionate to brutality.&nbsp;Over and above its functioning, the AFSPA has become a&nbsp;symbol&nbsp;of oppression in these areas. Its removal is a&nbsp;real, but also a psychological necessity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the Inlaks Artist Award, Aniruddha Barua has been selected for his exceptional practice. Barua studied&nbsp;printmaking, and has a mastery of lithography. He has worked on a series of lithographs of &#39;Supermen&rsquo; from his home, Guwahati. Barua&rsquo;s practice and his political commitment finds equal expression in projects in the public realm, and concerns of community art practice.&nbsp;He has been working deeply over several years with the&nbsp;community in Assam, and proposes a similar method of working in Bombay. For this exhibition he involves the nearby&nbsp;community, drawing attention to the law Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act of 1958&rsquo; and its necessary and urgent repeal. Bringing together the Supermen of his printmaking, and the &#39;Special Powers&rsquo; given to the army - he ironises the role of the army.&nbsp;In the current exhibition, he works closely with Irom Sharmila&rsquo;s brother, and a large community of people, to understand the Act, both from within and outside of zones marked &#39;disturbed areas&rsquo;, while pointing to new kinds of betrayals met with in the city, and how the Act remains in the psyche and perpetuates.&nbsp;A printmaker, you cannot somehow disregard the play on words in his title - his hate bites, is a kind of corrosive - acid bite, where the mind, the psyche, like the copper plate gets permanently etched upon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aniruddha Barua&nbsp;has sought stretching artistic dimensions for art in the public realm.&nbsp;As the founder of the Guwahati-based collective &#39;The Yellow Cab&rsquo;, which came together in 2011, the collective has made public interaction their own, devising new ways of being with others.&nbsp;They have been working consistently in rural Assam, making&nbsp;workshops, and psychologically trying to restore a sense of meaning, in villages that had been ravaged by riots in Kukrajhar, Assam in 2013, in projects such as &lsquo;My India, My Home&rsquo; made in collaboration with Clark House Initiative Bombay.&nbsp;The Yellow Cab promotes views using multiple methods like video projection, digital text, news print, and performance, exploring the levels of meaning of each concept and its connotations for an audience. The collective&nbsp;acts as campaigners or as provocateurs stimulating debate for positive social change. While thinking about wider social reform, they seek to expand the frontiers of aesthetic experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collective has traveled to Manipur, for a project&nbsp;&lsquo;Hunger and Hungry: 12 years running&rsquo; where they addressed the issue of Irom Sharmila&rsquo;s 12 year long fast in protest against AFSPA.&nbsp;In a public art event that preceded this, called &#39;The hunger of hungry: 11 years and counting&rsquo; the collective paid homage to the &#39;Iron Lady of Manipur&rsquo;, Irom Sharmila, by 2011 on an eleven-year hunger fast. Barua wrote at the time:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;We have been travelling to various places meeting different people,various classes and categories of people in the&nbsp;same society: people in the markets, schools, colleges, offices, railway stations. We introduced ourselves as TYC asking them about Manipur&rsquo;s AFSPA Act and Irom Sharmila, and trying to know their views regarding this issue. It is a sharing process, whatever we know, we were trying to give, and what we were not aware of, we were trying to gain knowledge regarding the issue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have been questioning them on some topics as to why Irom Sharmila, even after eleven years of fasting, the central government hasn&rsquo;t done anything? Why is it that they are trying to not see a problem which is so wide and vast. Are they trying to cover up the situation? If news like this from any other place in India is heard, of someone doing the same thing for even a week, it becomes the national news, even the ruling party wishes to talk with them. Why is it not the same with Irom Sharmila? Is it because she belongs to the North East? Why has the media not focussed on it as yet?&#39;&nbsp;The group made over seven hundred photographs, of people&rsquo;s expressions, trying to capture traces of their despair, their individual emotion and gestures, some cover their face, some cover their eyes, some hurt their faces, some look down, look away, to express their emotions on the subject of the army and its excess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition is a serious reflection by artist Aniruddha Barua on the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and the psychological trauma of it on the people of the North Eastern regions of India. Barua is concerned with how the 56-year long enforcement of this Act had been affecting the lives of the people in Assam and in Manipur. By gathering close experience of being within such an environment, he asserts that the implementation of this Act has disturbed the growth and lives of especially the younger generation of that region. According to Barua, AFSPA is acting as &lsquo;acid bite&rsquo; on the brains of the youngsters.&nbsp;This exhibition is an effort by the artist to raise opinion regarding the same, from a group of north-eastern youth residing in Bombay. He chose diverse mediums to construct a conversation. He has interacted with young people regarding the issue, forcing them to trace old memories and their roots. They were asked about their own lives and those traumas they inherited, from their parents&rsquo; and grandparents&rsquo; generations. Barua&nbsp;has painted ideas, expressions and views on their body, or on plaques, or embroidered them into their clothes; as if it is an inseparable part of their lives. These have been digitally documented for the exhibition. He has also painted directly onto the wall, on circular wooden plates that he fitted with handles, as a metaphor of these youngsters&rsquo; brains and their conditions after getting affected by the act&rsquo;s consequences. &#39;Beauty to me means a sense of clear perception rather than reason. The idea is to project art &amp; its demand for social change from a contemporary perspective.&#39;&nbsp;He asks, and ponders, equally acutely, the very present racism as it is faced by ethnic minorities within this supposedly cosmopolitan city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Text by Zasha Colah and&nbsp;Bala Karchaudhuri</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bala Karchaudhuri, Assistant Curator, Mumbai Art Room.

These freedoms are often economic but also extend to the political and the social. Hong Kong stands on such a confluence of freedoms that are restricted and monitored in&nbsp;China.&nbsp;Foreign journalists reporting on China situate themselves on the island enjoying laws that uphold the sanctity of the third estate.&nbsp;Hong Kong&rsquo;s freedoms are a gift of a colonial legacy, that were not maintained in the concessions of Shanghai after the fall of the Kuomintang. Nevertheless, they are endangered, especially when one encounters the complexities that are involved in choosing a Chief Executive of the city. In such a situation we could enumerate on the role of the media, especially news networks, where of late we have witnessed their efficient abilities at influencing voting patterns in democracies.&nbsp;</p>', '<p>Gum Cheng thus refuses to let newspapers and television networks archive him.&nbsp;If all questions are framed only around the art market, he slows&nbsp;down the televised film-byte - through the act of drawing - and re-distributes the information and what was spoken, so that the emphasis gives space to alternatives to the market. Slowing down film is his technique of appropriation and politics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheng is a Hong Kong based artist, who runs a radical art space called C&amp;G Apartment with his partner Clara Cheung. He returns to Bombay after a public art project - about learning classical Indian dance by slowing it down - on Juhu Beach made with with the curatorial collaborative Art Oxygen last year.&nbsp;Outside the booth of Asia Art Archive during Art Basel Hong Kong, Gum and Clara are interviewed about their perspectives on the art market. Having run an alternate space that funds itself from tuitions it earns from painting classes each day, Clara and Gum draw one&rsquo;s attention to the lack of participation of local artists. Free Capital flows and the absence of customs and duties have allowed Hong Kong to turn into a burgeoning global market for art. Recording the televised program, called&nbsp;&lsquo;The Works&rsquo;, he breaks up the video into 10 important sentences, rendering them with Chinese ink on Vietnamese handmade paper.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loretti Joyce Pinto began etching the digging up of the hillsides that surrounded her village by rogue mine owners who were shipping illegally the hills of Goa to feed the unending appetite for iron and manganese ore in China. Land acquisition for mining and real estate of the the Comunidade land that was collectively owned by the residents of the village destroyed a system of community ownership and responsibility across villages in Goa. Her village Sirdao is a valley between many plateaus and inhabited by a community of fish farmers. Using ancient aqua ducts, dykes and small dams that are consecrated by the indigenous Catholic saints of Goa, these villagers grew paddy near the mangroves by regulating the movement of sea water. The rest of the year they reared fish. As the forested plateaus began to be sold to mining consortiums and real estate developers these vocations began to disappear due to the destruction of a fragile ecology. The realtors and the miners flattened or quarried the plateaus and the springs began to disappear as tourists began to trickle into South Goa. This led to an escalation of land prices and soon it became difficult for villagers to afford homes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pinto began a community campaign against these large acquisitions of land, studying tenure-ship records and Goan civil laws formulated by the Portuguese, she faced stiff opposition from the Politico-Builder-and-Miner lobby that tried in vane to buy her out and then threatening her. As a printmaker and artist she was rebelling against the patrons of art in Goa and was making her family very concerned for her safety. She began recording her own rebellion against the economic inquisition in her etchings by studying the murals in the disappearing and neglected old 16th century churches that surrounded Sirdao. Pinto made a set of drawings that comment on the exodus of Goans to the United Kingdom in recent years which they do so by surrendering their Indian passports and opting for Portuguese citizenship benefitting from their Lusitane colonial legacy. Thus her drawings while documenting the destruction of her village also imagine the construction of big cities in China relating them to the destruction and rise of Vijaynagara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yogesh Barve uses a glazed brown martavan or tea urn, used by opium merchants to bring back Tea from Hong Kong to comment on the &#39;lack of perspective&rsquo;, the title of his sculpture. The urn was found in Bombay&rsquo;s chor bazaar or flea market, cracked but with an intact dragon. Barve affixes on it a ceramic electric conductor found near a railway track on which he casts multiple cones made out of white cement that refute the idea of perspective and dimensions essential for an object like a ceramic urn. India had a trade in ceramics and porcelain that came primarily through the route taken to export opium to China. In the early 20th century a Parsi man began a ceramic production facility in Morvi, Gujarat that would copy the techniques from China to make figurines and chinware, failing to create ceramics of similar quality in the 1950s they moved on to make electronic conductors that lead to the establishment of a large ceramic industry in the region.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGum (Yee Man) Cheng is an artist and social worker from Hong Kong.

Still there remain the questions: when do the happenings of the timeless and suspended past start to become fragmented into particular arrangements recorded and remembered? And who will define them? How do we in actuality experience the past and history &ndash; is it through a continual need for memory creation? When does the past begin to become history?&nbsp;</span></p>', '<p>This exhibition presents five contemporary artists whose works relate to these questions in differing ways. These artworks do not refer to the past as something static, but are rather based on the artist&rsquo;s subjective or collective affiliations, desires, fears, and influences, shaped by images and stories which come to mind in the present. Thus they seem to refer to the history made out of the past, a history which is not fixed, but operates as a very present active subject, that at any time here and now can be re-explored, revisited and newly reviewed. The artists are actively retelling, redefining, and re-negotiating meanings, within an ever-changing context of the present. They look for the verges, where points of reference and diverse narrations proliferate, where dynamics has no specific and single direction, and where stories overlap. They focus on nuance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By using diverse forms of artistic utterance, the artists create subjective differences of history. They present readings of artistic narratives that have come down to us &ndash; the way they were created and shaped, as well as the ways they came to be distributed. The artists look back to how particular histories have been constructed, and by which means they are preserved, focussing not on the reconstruction of particular narratives, but rather, offering alternate readings of them, while opening up an active space in which these narratives live among us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u>About the artists:</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anna Ostoya </strong>(b. 1978 in Cracow, lives and works in New York) refers in her practice to avant-garde and Polish Modernism (including references to Kazimir Malevich, Donald Judd, Katarzyna Kobro and Władysław Strzemiński among others). Ostoya confronts art historical narratives and their socio-political dimensions from East European and Western perspectives, while also paying attention to the resemblances and differences in materials and forms used. Her method is one of re-appropriation from different art works, creating collages, patchworks, sets, and installations. She places them, however, in the actual context and time in which they appear, creating textural coherence between past and present. &lsquo;Untitled (Scroll)&rsquo; 2011, is an elaborate multi-thread photomontage of reproductions of works from her &lsquo;Autopis&rsquo; series. The series has been shown, among other places, at Foksal Gallery in Warsaw (1966 - present), which had a strong theoretical basis and tradition of showing avant-garde contemporary artists. In these works she re-construes the avant-garde discourse, relating it for example to the situation of women in the art world by positioning Foksal&rsquo;s earlier masculinised structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Agnieszka Polska </strong>(b. 1985 in Lublin, lives and works in Warsaw and Amsterdam) treats the present almost as a failure, situating her films often in the past. She works with the process of archiving and its particular ways of structuring the past &ndash; she looks behind the curtain to real remnants and what has been forgotten, skillfully blending archival materials with her own fabricated ones. She is almost reconstructing particular histories, chosen by her; but the works are constructions of her own imagination and interpretation, rather than reconstructions. In her films there is an oniric colourless nostalgia, perhaps driven by a Freudian sense of the utopia of the past. In the film &lsquo;Sensitization to Colour&rsquo; 2009, she recreates the performance of the almost forgotten avant-garde Polish figure, Włodzimierz Borowski (1930-2008), and his event that took place in Od Nowa Gallery, Poznań, in 1968. Based on photographs and notes she makes her own interpretation of this event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Karol Radziszewski </strong>(b. 1980 in Białystok, lives and work in Warsaw) in his film, &lsquo;America Is Not Ready For This&rsquo; 2012, he seems to say, after CS Lewis, that we cannot understand ourselves by ourselves. In the project, based on a research trip, Radziszewski follows Natalia LL&rsquo;s &ndash; a representative of the then neo-avant-garde &ndash; trip to New York that she made in the 70s, considered almost the grand journey from East to West. He makes the same route that she had made, and meets the same people she had encountered. He retraces this journey creating multiple perspectives through documentary footage, based on his interviews with a number of people. Radziszewski not only points to how much it has changed, but also to how Natalia LL was perceived differently from East European perspectives of that time, in her own perspective, and from Western ones. He also presently relates himself to the same issues she was tackling then &ndash; gender, sexuality, consumerism, a certain clash of expectations between herself as an artist and the art world. He not only examines different positions from which history is created, but also how history is told and propelled, and he explores extremely current and differing perspectives of how it is experienced by individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a way <strong>Janek Simon </strong>(b. 1977 in Cracow, lives and works in Warsaw) explores history using relational artistic geography as one of his working methods. Simon is a constant researcher, being in a state of continual journey, from Madagascar to India, from China to Nigeria. He changes his positions so often that he is in a constant flux, which luckily enables him to escape from postcolonial-tourist exploitation, over-enthusiasm, or even abuse. He uses this to produce a spacious socio-political practice, that can embrace and articulate his artistic thoughts, and is focused on a constant negotiation between meanings. In his project &lsquo;Sculptures from the Museum of Man in Paris Made Based on Oskar Hansen&rsquo;s and Lech Kunka&rsquo;s Drawings&rsquo; 2014, he recreates the sculptures after Oskar Hansen (1922-2005) an architect, and Lech Kunka (1920-1978) a painter, who visited the Museum of Man in the 40s. He makes his own interpretations of their impressions and memories after visiting one of the most impressive ethnological collections of the time in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rafał Wilk</strong> (b. 1979 in Lubań, lives and works in Warsaw and Zielona G&oacute;ra) uses various artistic forms which span from paintings and video to computer animation. In his practice he deals with either forgotten or hidden histories of Europe &ndash; which he treats as a complex concept. He often situates himself within a fabricated story &ndash; based on historical facts and figures &ndash; playing the role of an overriding narrator. In his film &lsquo;Szpak&rsquo; 2008, the artist refers to Marian Szpakowski (1926-1983), an artist who in the early 50s moved to live in the small city of Zielona G&oacute;ra, and somehow managed to create a vibrant art community there. Wilk, according to private archives, and conversations with Leszek Kania, imagines Szpakowski&rsquo;s past, or rather invents an ideal picture of it, creating hypothetical events, preserved in an Arcadian atmosphere. He shows how artists might have spent their free time, time we almost never think of, which is usually left out of the official version of art history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Patrycja Ryłko</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u>Works in the exhibition:</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anna Ostoya, &lsquo;Untitled (Scroll)&rsquo;, photomontage of reproductions of works from the &lsquo;Autopis&rsquo; series, archival pigment print on paper, 61 x 216 cm, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agnieszka Polska, &lsquo;Sensitization to Colour&rsquo;, from the series &lsquo;Three Videos with Narrator&rsquo;, HD video, 5:02 min, 2009, &copy; Agnieszka Polska, courtesy ŻAK | BRANICKA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Karol Radziszewski, &lsquo;America Is Not Ready For This&rsquo;, HD/BluRay, 67 min, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Janek Simon, &lsquo;Sculptures from the Museum of Man in Paris Made Based on Oskar Hansen&rsquo;s and Lech Kunka&rsquo;s Drawings&rsquo;, printed on a homemade 3D printer, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rafał Wilk, &lsquo;Szpak&rsquo;, DVD video, stereo sound, 7:51 min, 2008; &lsquo;Limit of control&rsquo;, HD video, stereo sound, 10:51 min, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All works courtesy the artists and their galleries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition will be accompanied by a publication which details the work of the selected artists and the artists of the Polish avant-garde to whom they refer.

These experimental works, a blend of fiction, animation and documentary, explore different modes of narration, and play on audience alienation and involvement. Bertolt Brecht&rsquo;s V-Effekt was a determining factor in the evolution of art in the 20th century and drew on the notion of estranging the spectator through atypical and perturbing mechanisms. As opposed to the classical cinema, where the spectator is lulled into an almost dream-like altered state of consciousness, these distancing texts break from the illusion of reality by disrupting the flow of fiction. Characters staring into the camera challenge and address us directly, break open the &ldquo;fourth wall&rdquo;, that crucial boundary separating the world of fiction (diegesis) from the real world. The audience is then no longer a passive receptor but must participate in the creation of meaning through a genuine dialogue with the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it&nbsp;could be said that all narrative art since Brecht must position itself somewhere between the two extremes of this narrative spectrum, the selection of films at hand focuses on works that explore the more radical end of the continuum. Modulated along a series of sub-themes, these films depict the quest for personal and collective identities; challenge a priori notions of sexuality and gender roles; and reach out to the spectator beyond the fourth wall of the screen. The title of the programme itself is a quotation of Belgian director Chantal Akerman&rsquo;s seminal 1975 film &ldquo;Je tu il elle&rdquo;, an avant-garde work on the search of self as well as a striking illustration of the gaze theory and scopophilia in cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">About the curator</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Adi Chesson&nbsp;is a Brussels-based film journalist from Bombay, assistant editor at Format.Court.com&nbsp;and curator for Short Screens.

(16, 1, 'The Meaning of Return: Scott Myles', '1 March – 30 April 2014', '<p>A suite of prints made directly onto the walls of the Mumbai Art Room, which will be whitewashed away at the end of the exhibition, show an array of sculptural objects laid out across an expansive floor. The squarish room in the&nbsp;prints, a ballet studio with a mirrored wall at one end and barres running horizontally along the other walls, is not unlike the space of the Mumbai Art Room itself, with one wall comprised entirely of panes of glass doors. Self-referentially, the previous exhibition played with the dimensions of the room, to resemble a single vitrine, or entry into the space of the diorama. In the current presentation by Scott Myles, (born 1975 in Dundee, Scotland) the public space of the gallery is&nbsp;likened to a ballet studio, a space of private performative gestures - like an artist studio - for rehearsal, and trial. In the ballet studio where the photographs were taken by Myles, he replaced the dancers with his own sculptures, composed of found objects - a&nbsp;wheelchair or the wheels of a swivel-chair, and parts the artist made to form his choreography of anthropomorphic performers in&nbsp;the space. The barres running horizontally may be read as a kind of horizon line, a bar for support and a line of stability, within a space of&nbsp;unlimited choreographic possibility for movement.&nbsp;</p>', '<p>Challengingly, these large unique screenprints in silver overlaid by black ink, serigraphed directly onto the wall, are changed by the surface textures of the walls - their bites, dips, scuffs and scratches. The walls and columned plinths of an art gallery space, meant for the&nbsp;display of work, become the work itself, and negate certain ideas of display-conventions at the first instance. Overlaid the idea of the gallery, is the idea of the ballet studio, and over this the idea of the artist&rsquo;s studio. The monochrome silver colour field of the wall prints over which the black inks of the photographs are printed, can be further likened to the silvering of the reverse-side of glass used to make mirror, and suggests also an allusion to moving image and film. The overlaying of metaphoric rooms is an enchanting part of&nbsp;Myles&rsquo; conceptual art practice. But this form of conceptual work is tinged with the romantic, in the crafted beauty of the shimmering silver and black printmaking inks, an aspect we are perhaps slowly coming to acknowledge within&nbsp;the common perception of&nbsp;conceptual art as dry or formulaic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myles&rsquo; use of silvering,&nbsp;mirroring, duplication, reversed images, twinning, doubling and reflection&nbsp;in his works&nbsp;are artistic techniques; interestingly, the very terms by which the philosopher Gilles&nbsp;Deleuze considered games that define the &#39;imaginary&rsquo;. For&nbsp;the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, the Imaginary Order is formed during the &#39;mirror stage&rsquo;, and is related to mimesis, to the copy, to the&nbsp;&lsquo;fraud&rsquo;, through&nbsp;the&nbsp;turning of oneself into an object that&nbsp;can be viewed by the baby from outside of himself, when they first&nbsp;recognise themselves in the mirror.&nbsp;In one of the wall-prints, two similar plinths stand side by side on the floor, their presence is again doubled and reflected in a mirror producing many alternate selves. The sculptures appear to be trying to make sense of themselves&nbsp;through their reflections in the mirror. If this is the realm of Lacan&rsquo;s mirror stage, then the horizontal supportive barre running around the room may suggest the notion of stability and unity, against the mise-en-abyme of the mirroring-Imaginary.&nbsp;Alternately, for Jean-Paul Sartre the imaginary&nbsp;was about freedom in the broadest sense, and he wrote that&nbsp;the extent to which an object could be visualised and held most distinctly and precisely in&nbsp;imagination, reveals the possibility to imagine other forms of social and cultural existence, the extent to which we can be free.&nbsp;To bring these concepts of the self-recognising mirror stage and the imaginary into the&nbsp;spatiality and temporality of the display gallery, and the studio, begins to raise the&nbsp;dimensions&nbsp;of what an audience enters an art gallery to do, and why. The work of the audience comes in focus in this exhibition, as much as the work of&nbsp;the artist as producer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presence of the missing artist takes the form of a triangular wooden sculpture, we meet as soon as we enter the small square room. The height and length of the sculpture corresponds exactly to the height of the artist - 194cms - as if to say: &lsquo;hello it&rsquo;s me&rsquo;. This work is evocatively titled &#39;Social Sculpture&rsquo;, and to some extent is an echo of the many triangular shapes of ladders and upturned chairs that make up the performing sculptures within the prints. A footrest on the diagonal plank echoes again the shape of the large triangle sculpture, immediately implying the performative nature of the sculpture. The audience is welcome to re-enact the first performance, where in 2008, Scott Myles performed &#39;Reciprocity On Three Planes&rsquo; in which the bodies of three people stood vertical, lay head-down within, or using the footrest leaned diagonally against each plane of the hollow triangular sculpture. A similar performance occurred in the space for this exhibition. Dressed in black, posing still and expressionless for twenty minutes, three members of the audience held a half-filled wineglass perfectly balanced with the horizon of the barre in the prints. The interactive nature of this sculpture, and the title, &lsquo;Social Sculpture&rsquo;, immediately connect with the idea of the art world itself as a &lsquo;social sculpture&rsquo;, in the way the conceptual artist Joseph Beuys extended the concept of art to art&#39;s&nbsp;potential to transform society, an artwork that includes human activity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The suite of prints were produced&nbsp;from a digital files of the separated photographic images, exposures were made with the Sir JJ School of Art - for the first time in this large-format size, and silk screens specially framed at this scale. The whole process of printing onto wall has been documented by the JJ printmaking studio, and is now being used for teaching purposes by Professor Anant Nikam, the head of the department, who lectures across colleges in Maharashtra.&nbsp;The social sculptor structures society using language, action, or objects.&nbsp;Playfully interactive, the sculpture collects fleeting performed gestures of the community and audience who enter the space, just as we begin to de-code the title of the suite of prints &lsquo;the meaning of return&rsquo;. There and gone, like the flash of a mirror&rsquo;s returned stare, it catches the dematerialised, temporal nature of exhibition making, or of thought; beheld in silver, for the brief time of the exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Zasha Colah</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott Myles, &lsquo;The Meaning of Return&rsquo;, a suite of five unique screenprints on wall, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott Myles, &lsquo;Social Sculpture&rsquo;, wood, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All works courtesy Scott Myles/ The Modern Institute/ Toby Webster Ltd, Glasgow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott Myles and Mumbai Art Room would like to acknowledge the support of&nbsp;Professor Anant Nikam and the Sir JJ School of Art, Bombay,&nbsp;Sachin Bonde, Nikhil Raunak, Mangesh Kapse, Prasad Nikumbh, Alexia Holt, Below Another Sky, Creative Scotland,&nbsp;Glasgow&nbsp;PrintStudio, Claire Forsyth,&nbsp;Scott&nbsp;Campbell, and Murray Robertson&nbsp;in the making of this exhibition.&nbsp;</p>', '', 'N', 'exhibition', '279963594-13_10_2015_23_25_38-1444758938.jpg', '', '', '773116846-16_10_2015_18_38_54-1445000934.jpeg', '', '', '354573983-16_10_2015_18_38_54-1445000934.jpeg', '', '', '834178009-16_10_2015_18_38_54-1445000934.jpeg', '', '', '119361827-16_10_2015_18_38_54-1445000934.jpeg', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 1, '<p>EVENT<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mumbaiartroom.org/projects.php?id=17\">Michiko Tsuda: Screenings</a></p>', '1', 'published', '2015-10-13 23:25:38', '2015-10-16 18:38:54'),

(19, 1, 'English Magic: a film by Jeremy Deller', '11 October – 23 November 2013', '<p>Presenting Jeremy Deller&rsquo;s film, <em>English Magic,</em> in India, the jewel in the crown of the former British Empire, conjures up delicious postcolonial ironies. As the artist himself has said, &ldquo;Britain is a very fertile place to make art, it&rsquo;s full of contradictions: we have this colonial past that we still haven&rsquo;t come to terms with, we have a class system that&rsquo;s fully functioning, we have a disparity between rich and poor, we have a royal family. All these things are there to be taken and worked on.&rdquo;*</p>', '<p>English Magic, made on the occasion of the 2013 Venice Biennale, looks at both the dark and light sides of British culture, reveling in current-day contradictions with joyous abandon. During this immersive fifteen-minute work, the only sound we hear is the lush uplifting music of the Melodians steel band playing a Caribbean genre of melodic percussion. The film opens with the diverse ensemble setting up in a location legendary in the annals of rock music&ndash;inside the famed Studio Two, where The Beatles recorded at Abbey Road. As the music begins, the first long segment shows wondrous slow motion&nbsp; footage of birds of prey. The artist is in particular referencing an incident involving a protected species in the UK, which turns out to have special significance. Two rare hen harriers were shot down from the sky over a British royal estate on a day in 2007 when Prince Harry and a friend were the only known people out hunting. There was a police investigation, but since the birds&rsquo; carcasses were never found, the case was dropped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next film section, loose but unmistakable connections continue. The harriers take revenge. The fierce steel claw of a mechanical crane toys with two Range Rovers, a frequent transport vehicle for the royal family, as well as a global symbol of wealth and privilege. For Deller, these cars represent the arrogance and materialism of British society. The music gets fun and rowdy, the cars are smashed, flattened and spun around midair, dumped in a junkyard for recycling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In the third part of </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">English Magic, </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Deller turns to the subject of one of the UK&rsquo;s most popular tourist attractions, the prehistoric site of Stonehenge. In 2012, he made an interactive sculpture of it in the form of a bouncy amusement park attraction, titled </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Sacrilege</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">. People young and old, agile and clumsy, play on the overblown sculpture, as Deller lightly turns his country&rsquo;s revered heritage into populist spoof.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Next we see clips from the annual London pageant known as The Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Show, a street parade begun almost 800 years ago by King John, who demanded that every newly-elected mayor of London travel to Westminster to swear loyalty to the crown. The camera zooms in on a few professions the artist seems to be targeting for their &ldquo;magical&rdquo; powers&ndash;military officials, religious leaders, costumed government representatives, tax advisors, and a big float with financial wizards, to name the most prominent. As wave after wave of people march by, washing over the viewer, there is a palpable sense of collective solidarity, fanfare and festivity, punctuated with hints of danger about the current state of affairs. It seems no accident that the song we hear in this part is David Bowie&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Man Who Sold the World.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The final scenes of the film go back to the passionate musicians&rsquo; performances in the recording studio, lingering over the players mid-song. It closes quietly and perhaps ominously, with an owl slowly turning to meet the viewer&rsquo;s gaze, followed by the band looking back at us as well.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Susan Hapgood</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the artist</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeremy Deller (b. 1966, London; lives London) studied Art History at the Courtauld Institute and at Sussex University.

The project introduces a new projected work and a series of wall pieces, which together experiment with the ways we perceive, process, and think about photographs. The artists have seamlessly crafted these works from disparate sources, layering and integrating pictures from the past and present. Their exhibition title, <em>Palimpsest</em>, refers to the Latin word for an overwritten manuscript using a writing material such as parchment or a tablet, derived from a Greek word meaning scraped again.</p>', '<p>As the artists state, &ldquo;<em>Palimpsest</em> comprises two discrete but connected works that dwell on the knowability of the photographic image. <em>Behaviour of Walls at 22.56˚N, 88.36˚E</em> combines photographs of peeling paint on a wall in the National Instruments Ltd. camera factory in Kolkata, with a cache of battered 35mm negatives we found among the garbage onsite. Ostensibly belonging to the company employees, the negatives are a record of their everyday lives as well as tests to assess the capabilities of the National 35 camera they were building at the factory. As negative (rather than positive) images, they produce a photographic estrangement whereby the viewer is invited to invert the image in his/her head. Another series titled <em>Bildungsroman, Chapter I,</em> relates to the found images of the workers&rsquo; children, and treats black and white photographs from our own family albums as another kind of &ldquo;found&rdquo; imagery depicting two children, who happen to be us, as often unwilling subjects for the camera. Here, the viewer becomes part of the work and activates the palimpsest.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Works in the exhibition</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Behaviour of Walls at 22.56˚N, 88.36˚E, </em>2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High-definition video projection, looped, silent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>25 minutes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Courtesy of the artists</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Bildungsroman, Chapter I,</em> 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Black and white photographs on backlit film,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>acrylic mirror, motion sensor, LED lights</p>\r\n\r\n<p>two 21 3/4 x 16 1/2 x 1 1/2&quot;; two 16 1/2 x 21 3/4 x 1 1/2&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Courtesy of the artists</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the Artists</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Madhuban Mitra and Manas Bhattacharya have been working collaboratively since 2008 and had their debut solo exhibition, <em>Through a Lens, Darkly</em>, at Photoink, New Delhi, December 2010-February 2011. Parts of that work have been shown at the Thessaloniki Photobiennale, Greece and in the Singapore International Photography Festival in 2010. <em>Through a Lens, Darkly</em> was longlisted for the Skoda Prize for Contemporary Indian Art 2011, and won the Breakthrough Artist Award. Apart from photography, they work with film &amp; video, animation, sound and text. Their video work has been shown in public spaces worldwide in the <em>Art By Chance</em> festival 2010, and in the Crosstalk Video Art Festival, Hungary; Isle of Wight Festival, UK; and the <em>Attraction of Opposites</em> programme of the International Film Festival Rotterdam, Netherlands, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their work explores questions of memory, urbanity and the body; and their particular interests include the histories of film and photography; the intersections of the analog and the digital; the blurred boundaries between documentary and fiction; and notions of the archive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The artists would like to thank the Media Lab, Jadavpur University for making their work in National Instruments Ltd. possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em>THIS EXHIBITION IS ONE OF A SERIES OF INLAKS SHIVDASANI FINE ARTS PROJECTS, SUPPORTED BY THE INLAKS SHIVDASANI FOUNDATION.</em></p>', '', 'N', 'exhibition', '878721019-26_10_2017_21_48_12-1509034692.PhP', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 3, 1, '', '1', 'published', '2015-10-13 23:54:33', '2017-10-26 21:48:12'),
(21, 1, 'Bijoy Jain and Kapil Gupta: Two Contemporary Architects', '28 June - 2 August 2013', '<p>For this exhibition, two architects, Bijoy Jain of Studio Mumbai, and Kapil Gupta of Serie Architects, have been invited to show their work, approaches, and inspirations.&nbsp; Curated by architect Aaron B. Schwarz, the presentation includes building models, a wall drawing, axonometric views, site images, project plans, working mockups and samples, giving visitors a window into each designer&rsquo;s projects and sensibilities.&nbsp;Both Mr. Jain and Mr. Gupta are established architects in India, and recently have been attracting world attention. This show demonstrates that their distinct contemporary design vocabularies are influenced by local building techniques, as well as the social, historic, and climatic conditions of the project environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', '<p>Geographic and cultural differences are rapidly becoming blurred in the styles and forms of contemporary architecture all over the world.&nbsp; Advancements in communication and media technology, ease of world travel, and commonality of overseas education and training, while all good, have led to homogenized architecture and replicated iconography.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, Bijoy Jain of Studio Mumbai and Kapil Gupta of Serie Architects have developed unique and distinct styles that always address the particular conditions of each building project. Both studios work with a deepened sense of context, going beyond the usual considerations of what is physically nearby. Their designs are strengthened and rooted by taking additional cues from the climate, history, social culture, available materials, local building practices, and other factors of new projects, whether here in India or in their work abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking about his curatorial intentions for this show, Aaron Schwarz notes, &quot;I believe that there is a culture of innnovative architectecture happening in India that contributes to the contemporary global design dialogue. Bijoy Jain of Studio Mumbai and Kapil Gupta, working with partner Christopher Lee of Serie Architects, have evolved their own distinct architectural languages and processes, which are enriched and developed for each particular new context.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the Architects</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kapil Gupta is the co-founder and principal, with Christopher Lee, of Serie Architects London, Mumbai and Beijing (www.serie.co.uk). The work of Serie is underpinned by the exploration of the problem of type and the city, with particular focus on the renewed relevance of typological reasoning and experimentation &ndash; or working projectively in series &ndash; to describe, conceptualize, theorize and ultimately project new typological ideas for and from the city. Serie was the recipient of the 2010 BD Young Architect of the Year Award and was named one of ten visionary architects by the Leading European Architects Forum in 2012.&nbsp; Gupta was a Director of the Urban Design Research Institute, Mumbai from 2003 to 2008, during which time he curated India&#39;s first entry to the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2006. He graduated with Honours from Sir JJ School of Architecture, Mumbai in 1996, followed by post-graduate studies at the Architectural Association School of Architecture London between 1996 and 1998.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded by Bijoy Jain in 1995, Studio Mumbai is a &quot;human infrastructure&quot; of skilled craftsmen and architects who design and build the work directly (www.studiomumbai.com). Their practice entails an iterative process, in which ideas are explored through the production of large-scale mock-ups, models, material studies, sketches, and drawings. They draw&nbsp; from traditional skills, local building techniques, materials, and an ingenuity arising from limited resources. Their endeavour is to show the genuine possibility in creating buildings that emerge through a process of collective dialogue and a face-to&ndash;face sharing of knowledge. Studio Mumbai has received numerous awards, including special mention at the 2010 Venice Architectural Biennale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the Curator</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aaron Schwarz is an architect currently living in Mumbai.&nbsp; He is an executive director and principal of the New York City based design firm, Perkins Eastman, and is the managing director of the firm&rsquo;s design operations in South Asia.&nbsp; He recently completed the design of the new campus for the India School of Business in Mohali and is currently working on several projects in India.

He adopts the pragmatic aesthetics of Bombay&#39;s contemporary street kiosks, but tangles them with classical archetypes of western history, providing viewers with an unusual exhibition encounter.</p>', '<p>The Calyx-Krater Chamber is both a functioning food stall and an immersive museological display. It is an ensemble of unique sculptural components produced in collaboration with individual sign painters, Dharavi potters, copper tambats, marble workers and metalsmiths of Bombay.&nbsp; At the centre of the room, as in an ancient Greek symposium, stands a large terracotta vessel. It is a recreated calyx-krater (krater from the Greek verb &kappa;&epsilon;&rho;ά&nu;&nu;&upsilon;&mu;&iota;, ker&aacute;nnymi&mdash; to mix), made in collaboration with Dharavi potters. In the fifth century B.C.E., the calyx-krater was invented to hold a wine concoction, and it served as a gathering place, an immovable hub of conviviality.

AR1). Baldwin&#39;s recent projects include installations at Parisian Laundry and Centre Clark, both in Montreal, Canada; at the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Canada; and at Space Studios in London, UK.

In this exhibition, works from two recent bodies of her work offer an excellent introduction to her vibrant and innovative creations.

Apfelbaum&#39;s sculptural and two-dimensional compositions are characterized by mesmerizing patterns and vibrant colors intrinsic to her unusual materials, which have included many kinds of textiles, raw pigment powder, sequins, and unfired polymer and plasticine modeling clays. Optical stimulation is heightened, and installation methods are raw.&nbsp;</p>', '<p>A wide range of associations come to mind, bouncing from building tiles and indoor carpets to childrens&#39; crafts and bakery dough&mdash;and yet at the same time, these works have roots in the many formal traditions of abstract painting, and the industrial appropriations and fabrication methods of Minimalist art. There is an equalization of aesthetic hierarchies and categories that Apfelbaum actively seems to court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the artist has written of the cloth floor work, from the &quot;Ombres&quot; series:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36.0pt;\">For the &quot;Ombres,&quot; I work with a found structure: each piece follows a specific manufacturer&rsquo;s color series, or ready-made color progression. I play at once on the rich, emotional associations of color and the ready-made structure. I am interested in pop and the everyday: repetition, reiteration and routine. I like ordinary, cheap and slightly tacky materials.&nbsp; Materials that you would not normally associate with art making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Describing the &quot;Feelies&quot;:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36.0pt;\">&nbsp;[The &quot;Feelies&quot; show] sense of immediacy, as opposed to the durability and permanence that always seems to me to be signified in painting. There is a focus on possibility and process as opposed to an end point. I think of it as automatic abstraction, a negative abstraction, more open, based on chance, creating order within even haphazard circumstance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36.0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The title of this show, <em>Second That Emotion</em>, springs from the image used for the exhibition poster of two Bombay kids, Vishaka Malode and Tanushri Tandel, flashing peace signs during the 2011 monsoon, grinning while standing ankle-deep in fresh rainwater outside the Mumbai Art Room. It simultaneously refers to Smokey Robinson and the Miracles&#39; song from the sixties, &quot;I Second That Emotion,&quot; and perhaps most importantly, invites the audience to reaffirm this exuberant abstraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the artist</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Polly Apfelbaum is a winner of the 2013 Rome Prize.

(25, 1, 'Sarai Reader 09: A Satellite', '15 February – 9 March 2013', '<p>Featuring Gurgaon Glossaries by Prasad Shetty, Rupali Gupte and Prasad Khanolkar</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selected by Raqs Media Collective</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this project, Raqs Media Collective has invited Mumbai-based architects and urbanists Prasad Shetty, Rupali Gupte, and Prasad Khanolkar, to conceive a satellite project that spins off from the larger nine-month exhibition titled Sarai Reader 09&nbsp; at the Devi Art Foundation in New Delhi.</p>', '<p>In Mumbai, Gurgaon Glossaries will be presented as an installation and a series of workshops. The project is based on the architects&#39; assembly of terms and processes pertaining to Gurgaon, the relatively new Indian city southwest of New Delhi that has mushroomed from a farming village into a major metropolis in less than 25 years. As Gupte, Khanolkar and Shetty explain:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a city settles, new terms emerge. Terms; not only as new words and phrases, but also new ways of doing things, new things, new relations and new practices. Gurgaon Glossaries is a compilation of such terms&mdash;terms by which the city of Gurgaon has been settling. These are micro-narratives of new practices and relationships that have emerged in the settling process. Settling here is not necessarily a resolution of city forces, nor is it a peaceful coexistence of different people and practices. It is rather a set of processes by which things get worked out&mdash;the elaborate mechanics which keep the city in a perpetual state of becoming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussions about poor infrastructure, degrading environment, absent government, developer-driven planning, growing consumerism, neo-liberal civil society, and inadequate cultural life have dominated characterizations of Gurgaon, the &#39;millenium city&#39; on the outskirts of Delhi. At the same time, its speedy financial growth, driven by a large number of corporate enterprises, has created a promise of prosperity. People come from all over India to take part in the opportunities available. Perspectives on Gurgaon oscillate between a critique of its awkward urbanity and a celebration of its tremendous promise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussions about many Indian cities seem to be trapped in the meta-narratives of deficient infrastructure, shoddy governance, environmental issues, capitalistic dominance, loss of rights and socio-cultural decay. These meta-narratives identify clear problems and create a context for immediate interventions, which create further problems. For example, the narrative about poor infrastructure has made way for large-scale infrastructure creation, which in turn causes displacement of people, which in turn causes creation of rehabilitation policy, which in turn causes environmental and cultural damage, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The form of the glossary allows simultaneous construction, dismantling and reconstructions of Gurgaon. It emerges as a city with a unique urbanity where modern city planning and development ideas overlap with pastoral sensibilities, where new kinds of entrepreneur-ships flourish, new civil society is configured, new negotiations take place, new legislations are experimented with and new cultures are formed. These micro-narratives have the capacity to complicate the easy meta-narratives, to get out of the problem-intervention-problem rat-race, to generate and sustain an interest in living-in and loving the city, to offer nuanced readings of the city and to find creative ways of engaging with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project is a satellite of the Sarai Reader 09 exhibition at the Devi Art Gallery, Gurgaon, curated by Raqs Media Collective. The work comprises of a glossary of 100 terms taking the form of image/text combinations, displayed throughout the exhibition space. Here, it&nbsp; becomes a discussion space punctuated by a series of planned and unplanned conversations about studying cities. Gurgaon Glossaries is the starting point for these dialogues, with a large central table forming the setting. A series of cubes above and below the table surfaces are reminiscent of a mini city erupting, housing the glossary. The light boxes embedded in the surface remind one of photographs tucked under glass tabletops in cheesy brokers&rsquo; offices in Gurgaon. The chairs form a collage of accrued desires. The glossary complicates the meta-narrative. It affirms our belief that cities get worked out beyond plans and conspiracies, beyond concepts and categories, beyond activism and policy, and beyond discourses and interventions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the Creators</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rupali Gupte, Prasad Khanolkar and Prasad Shetty are all architects and urbanists based in Mumbai.

(26, 1, 'Hemali Bhuta: The Column in Transit and &quot;The Wall Piece&quot;', '7 December 2012 - 26 January 2013', '<p>Hemali Bhuta&#39;s architectural intervention directly confronts the viewer, charging the entire space with its solid presence, its raw edge, its size and and placement. To the casual onlooker, it may look more like a leftover crumbling wall than a new contemporary sculptural installation that has just been built and carved. The work takes its cues from the history of the room, jutting out from the place at the back of the gallery where there is a vestigial structural column.&nbsp;</p>', '<p>This temporary site-specific installation, made of local silica sand, faced with painted plaster of paris, was conceived for this particular exhibition space and built in situ as a sort of shrine or memorial. Mumbai Art Room&#39;s location was first a two-car garage in the base of the Pipewala Building, then a karate studio, and in early 2011 was refurbished to become a contemporary exhibition space. During that renovation, a large nest of white ants (termites) was discovered inhabiting one of the walls, producing a few small puckers in the wall&#39;s surface that gave a subtle indication of the lacy network of boreholes that lay behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entire history was taken into consideration by Bhuta when she conceived the construction of a wall jutting into the exhibition space, halving it into two distinct areas, and showing a raw edge made with the material used in termite barriers to ward off inundations of white ants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has paid close attention to the architectural components of the Mumbai Art Room space, creating a structure coming from a column, becoming a wall. She considers the building components to be transmitters, or catalysts, that expose their pasts, through projections, depressions, and other structural indicators. Humans, too, make their homes around themselves, obsessing about every square inch of space. Her installation is made with silica sand, a material that is a component of the Colaba terrain. Bhuta alludes to themes of vulnerability, fragility, and temporality.</p>', '<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">The casual observer may not even recognize the installation as an artwork, or notice that the artist is responding to the architectural space and dividing it, sculpturally and structurally, into differing zones, forcing the viewer to adopt a particular position on one side or the other.&nbsp; With this fairly large construction, she manages to create something that impacts the movement of the viewer, yet can almost hide in plain sight, can be absorbed into its surroundings. She agrees with contemporary Japanese architect Tadao Ando&#39;s statement, &ldquo;You cannot simply put something new into a place. You have to absorb what you see around you, what exists on the land, and then use that knowledge along with contemporary thinking to interpret what you see.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Bhuta works with abstract forms familiar from international sculptural traditions, and imbues them with meanings that are specific, local, and rooted. She has written, &quot;this work intends to unveil the decay caused within the wall/ column and in turn the structure/ foundation, thus exposing the vulnerability, fragility and the temporality of all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">About the artist</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Hemali Bhuta is an internationally recognized artist based in Mumbai, where she was born in 1978. She received her M.V.A. diploma in painting from M.S.

Mixing and remixing are widespread compositional techniques in contemporary culture. In this exhibition, movie clips are digitally combined to make altogether new compositions. Two works are here presented simultaneously. The work on the TV monitor by Swiss-American artist Christian Marclay, titled <em><u>Telephones</u></em> (1995), is a very early example of this artist&#39;s technique of assembling film bits to set up loose narrative connections that leap from one clip to the next. In Christian Marclay&#39;s words, &quot;When you get that sync between the elements, it&#39;s like magic.&quot;&nbsp; The work projected on the wall, <em><u>Doomed</u></em> (2007), by Australian artist Tracey Moffatt (in collaboration with Gary Hillberg), presents one form of monstrous catastrophe after another, accompanied by a cheezy fast-paced musical score. Tongue firmly in cheek, she critiques the popular spectacularization of disaster.</p>', '<p>The collage technique, first made from assembling cut-and-pasted pieces of paper taken from disparate sources to create something new, has permeated virtually every art form throughout the twentieth and twenty-first century, expanding with each different technology it touches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From French artist Pablo Picasso&#39;s <em>Still-Life with Chair Caning</em> (1912) to the montage technique introduced in Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein&#39;s silent movie <em>Potemkin </em>(1925), to the practice of DJs who mix and sample music, the method has many precedents<em>. </em>In the visual arts field, video art became a viable medium in the 1970s, after the 1967 introduction of the Portapak camera, which was affordable and accessible to people outside the movie business. The remixing practices seen here have expanded more recently, facilitated by Final Cut Pro video-editing software which was introduced to the market in 1999.</p>', '<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Legally speaking, the United States&#39; principle of &quot;fair use&quot; (which is even more lenient than the Commonwealth nations&#39; principle of &quot;fair dealing&quot;) allows the quoting of other copyrighted material, or intellectual property, as long as the new composition is considered transformative rather than derivative. Fair use allowance also tends to favor short bits rather than extensive reuse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">With the public accessibility of more moving images than anyone could have imagined just ten years ago, it seems natural that they are now art material too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Christian Marclay (b. 1955, California) is a Swiss-American visual artist and composer who lives in New York and London.

From 1977 - 1980 he studied sculpture at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston. He also studied as a visiting scholar at Cooper Union in New York in 1978. As performer and sound artist Christian Marclay has been experimenting, composing and performing with phonograph records and turntables since 1979 to create his unique &quot;theater of found sound.&quot; Christian Marclay offers a unique, fresh and innovative voice that has inspired an entire generation of musicians, artists and theorists.

A quintessential selection of the artist&#39;s work, these small-scale drawings all date from 2007, made with ink on paper, the artist&#39;s favored medium. They exemplify Shrigley&#39;s aim to &quot;communicate as simply and directly as possible.&quot;</p>', '<p>Shrigley&#39;s straightforward technique and dark humor have drawn accolades for over twenty years, gathering steady recognition to date. He invents scenarios and situations that reveal an absurd and mordant sensibility, most often combining image and text. Shrigley is an artist and a cartoonist, working with the liberties of both professions but none of their restrictions. His works skewer any notion that art must be solemn in order to be serious. In their deliberately crude execution, these drawings remind us intensely of the halting process of thinking, putting thoughts to paper; Shrigley has described it as somewhere between handwriting and drawing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questioned recently about his dark sense of humor, Shrigley answered, &quot;Well, I suppose it&rsquo;s a cathartic thing. It enables you to say what you want to say, and vent your anger about just the lunatic, idiot world we live in. I think I&rsquo;m a much saner person because I&rsquo;m able to make work about how horrible people are, and how unacceptable it is that they are so horrible and how unacceptable it is that people accept how horrible these people are. I kind of assume that&rsquo;s a given for everybody, that everybody feels that there are aspects of contemporary life in an advanced capitalist society that are really unacceptable, but what can we do to change it? Make stupid drawings I suppose.&quot; (Interview with Dave Eggers, <em>David Shrigley: Brain Activity</em>, Hayward Publishing, 2012)</p>', '<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Shrigley was born in 1968 in Macclesfield, England, and currently lives in Glasgow, Scotland.

As Kumar recounts, &quot;When I was a child I used to see huge sandalwood trees all over the region where I was growing up. Now when I visit the same places I can&#39;t find a single sandalwood tree because of its precious properties, there is so much demand for it. I want to promote in people an essential awareness to look around our environment and identify ourselves with the ecological system, take on our responsibility to&nbsp;pass it on to the future without interfering much in the legacy and genes. It is very important to find ways to conserve and regenerate our ecological system, when our greed has been playing a major role in imbalancing the system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><br />\r\n&nbsp;-&nbsp;Susan Hapgood</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">About the artist<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Arunkumar was born in Karnataka, and studied sculpture at M.

Comprising signs, lightboxes, and other tropes from the public arena, the exhibition invites viewers to reflect upon our oversaturated visual environments, to speculate on the appropriate settings for the individual works, and to consider how meanings can &nbsp;drift, change or vanish, depending on context. The works have been produced in collaboration with various local tradespeople of Mumbai.</p>', '<p>In the words of the artist, &ldquo;in this exhibition, I&#39;ve tried to create a situation where significant components of our shared contemporary moment are brought together, providing an opportunity to sort things out or let them fall apart. I am interested in the ways we all maintain the roles of protagonists and antagonists, the good guys and the enemies we so desperately require to define our political selves&mdash;the cowboys of the American west, or the German Nazis, for instance. Shadows of earlier anti-fascist sentiments continue to animate our vocabularies, and as we move through a period of pronounced iconographic migration, I wonder if our access to clarity is enhanced or further challenged in such an oversaturated, overstimulated environment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Civilians and the Military</em> is the third part of my ongoing exploration of the play, <em>Hurlyburly</em>, by David Rabe. The play is driven by numerous, lengthy sessions of banter wherein the characters are reaching to understand and define how they fit into the abject, disjointed culture of the contemporary moment, in this case Los Angeles of the 1980s. As the play develops, the discussions between the protagonists progress deeper into an increasingly layered loss of definition. In the end they fail to define the culture they are a part of, they fall apart, and so does the play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have expectations of the work of art&mdash;it previously illuminated the sublime achievements and failures of the human condition.

The release copy of Peter Watkin’s 1971 psycho-drama-cum-pseudo-documentary </span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Punish-ment Park </em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">is essentially screened </span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">without</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> a screen during sunset, back onto the landscape of El Mirage, the dry lakebed in the San Bernardino Desert of California, where the original film was shot.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lone 35 mm projector stands in the lower left hand corner of the frame in an empty desert location with its reels turning. The colour of the ground deepens, the sky tints over time, a stray bird flies by. As the pink of the sun settles, a beam of light can be seen emanating from the machine. It cuts across an expanse that is slowly bleeding into black. Throughout the 90-minute video, the soundtrack of Watkins’ film<em>, </em>which plays out the moral and political indignation of the anti-war counter-culture of the Nixon-\'Nam years, can be heard. <em>Punishment Park</em>, which was highly contro-versial when it first came out, was censored in the United States, kept from any serious circulation, for over 25 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohanian’s is a conceptual gesture that amplifies the object-hood of cinema, making it the subject of the work.  What is “seen” in the video recording is the reality of a place at a given point in time<ins cite=\"mailto:Nida%20Ghouse\" datetime=\"2012-10-18T08:09\">,</ins> onto which a cinematic representation of that same place from an earlier point in time is being projected. The image that is being projected, and the image of the projector, are both ab-sorbed infinitely and into the night. Has Ohanian set up an apparatus for the compression of time? The image from this prior moment—i.e. the image from <em>Punishment Park</em>—is not visible, but the film can be heard. Materially speaking, if light is comprised of packets of photons, then the particles are present in the picture, which is to say that the image is there.</p>', '<div style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">\r\n<p>In <em>A Territory of No Event – comment </em>(2007), an image of a place is presented, again and again, alongside a litany of legends that have come to define that place. The image is of a desert patch, of some-thing that might be called nothing. The legends are about a place, close to the Mapimi Basin in Mexico, known as la Zona del Silencio (the Zone of Silence), where in 1970, a missile launched from a U.S. mili-tary base lost control and landed. Ohanian grew interested in the place and began this project after years of looking for a location on the surface of this earth where nothing could be recorded. It had long been said that radio signals don’t always operate in la Zona del Silencio; sound broadcasting de-vices tend to malfunction. There is interference from the atmosphere such that stories have taken on the shape of cosmic dust and there are times when the reality of what is being transmitted itself disappears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this work, two slide projectors <span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">operate side by side simultan</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">eously. Ohanian sets up a device through which image and text seem to provide contradictory descrip-tions of the same place, a geo-graphic location that is believed to have close connections to both the future and the past. Is this then a work about the transference of place across time? From the image it seems there is nothing much to record of this territory, and the text suggests that there might be a magnetic force field moving somewhere around the site that prevents anything from being recorded. The tales that the text tells cannot be seen in the image, but they might have hap-pened, or perhaps one day they will.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this exhibition, there are only two still frames of the desert on display, with an open invocation to all the images that might inhabit it.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">About the artist</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Melik Ohanian was born in France in 1969, and lives and works in Paris and New York. His work has been shown in many solo exhibitions including: Galerie Chantal Crousel and Palais de Tokyo, Paris; South London Gallery, London; De Appel, Amsterdam; IAC, Villeurbanne; Yvon Lambert, New York; Museum in Progress, Vienna; and Matucana 100, Santiago de Chile. He has participated in many group exhibitions, in particular the São Paulo biennial (representing France), the Berlin and Sydney biennials in (2004), the Moscow and Lyon biennials (2005), the Gwangju and Seville biennials (2006), the Venice Biennale  (2007), and the Sharjah Biennial  (2011). Ohanian\'s<span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"> work can be understood in terms of physical and conceptual territories that focus on the concept of time. Drawing on research and scientific and philosophical methodology he has developed a body of work that uses a wide range of mediums. His installations examine the operative mode of the exhibition and extend beyond the usual boundaries of images, in their spatial and temporal dimensions. By placing the viewer in an exploratory role, the artist highlights the complexity of temporal intervals, which, in more or less obvious ways, govern our relationship to the world and others.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Works in the exhibition</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><em>Invisible Film</em>, 2005 </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Video projection, HDcam on DVD, with surround 4.1 sound, monitor with subtitles of the original film <em>Punishment Park</em> © Peter Watkins, 1971,  duration 90 minutes. <span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Courtesy the artist and Galerie Chantal Crousel, Paris</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><em>A Territory of No Event - comment, </em>2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Two synchronised slide projections, 160 images, dimensions variable. </span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Courtesy the artist and Galerie Chantal Crousel, Paris</span></p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://shoppingkratom.com/\" style=\"font-size:0px;\">ShoppingKratom</a>', 'N', 'exhibition', '514920143-15_10_2015_22_25_39-1444928139.jpg', '', 'Melik Ohanian, The Invisible Film, 2005.

(34, 1, 'Indian Street Photography: Alive and Well', '11 November 2011 - 6 January 2012', '<p>Street photography is thriving in India, having enjoyed an uninterrupted existence for over thirty years.&nbsp; This exhibition presents a small selection of Indian street photography from the past three decades, featuring work by Ravi Agarwal, Pablo Bartholomew, Chirodeep Chaudhuri, Shahid Datawala, Dhruv Malhotra, Anne Maniglier, Zubin Pastakia, Ram Rahman, Riddhi Shah, Ketaki Sheth, and Sooni Taraporevala. Today&rsquo;s street photography is spurred primarily by local artistic commitment and innovation, but also by radical demographic shifts of the population from rural to urban environments, by superabundant subject matter, and by urgent social issues. The Indian tradition of street photography first developed out of photojournalism, with contributing influences from Henri Cartier-Bresson and other foreign photographers. With the widening acceptance of photography as an art form in India, its street photography is getting well-deserved art historical attention.</p>', '<p>These photographers must consciously decide how to grapple with critical conditions of poverty, overpopulation, and environmental crisis. What appears to be a positive form of bearing witness or searing social activism to one viewer may strike another as near-pornographic voyeurism&mdash;a spectacle eliciting pity&mdash;or worse, a picture that elicits&nbsp;<em>schadenfreude</em>, pleasure derived from the misfortune of others. Some of the artists choose to tackle these subjects directly. Some make more subtle visual statements that are still loaded with social import. And some artists quite intentionally avoid urgent socio-political problems altogether. &nbsp;No matter what kinds of images they produce, these photographers are all drawn to the practice of shooting on the street, making completely spontaneous visual sense of a moving kaleidoscope, to steal a phrase from artist Ravi Agarwal.</p>', '', 'N', 'exhibition', '753748856-03_11_2015_12_09_23-1446532763.jpg', '', 'Riddhi Shah, <i> Peak Hours</i>, 2011.

(35, 1, 'Sammlung Ludwig: Art of the Sixties &amp; Hans Haacke: The Chocolate Master', '30 September - 5 November 2011', '<p>Curated by David Platzker</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An unlikely subject for an exhibition, this astutely curated project celebrates two books: <em>Sammlung Ludwig: Art of the Sixties</em>, and Hans Haacke&rsquo;s <em>The Chocolate Master/Der Pralinenmeister. </em>For those visitors who are reading between the lines, there is much to be gleaned from this many-layered presentation. It offers an array of images from the fantastic and world renowned Ludwig art collection with its concentration of Pop Art paintings. It is an installation that is in itself a visual feast of late 60s graphic design; and finally, the show offers a cautionary tale about private/public museum funding models as parsed by prominent contemporary artist Hans Haacke.</p>', '<p>The first publication, <em>Sammlung Ludwig: Art of the Sixties</em> was designed by the artist Wolf Vostell to document and commodify the collection of the German chocolate manufacturer Peter Ludwig and his wife Irene. Produced in five expanding editions between January 1969 and November 1971, this catalogue is highly coveted today in the United States and Europe as a quintessential design object of the period. It is clad in clear vinyl covers, a Plexiglas spine, stainless steel screw binding, and has transparent pages with artist portraits and an encyclopedic content of art of the Sixties as collected by the Ludwigs. The <em>Sammlung Ludwig</em> defines great design and voracious art collecting. The color reproductions within offer a cross-sectional view a particularly seminal period, showing key art works from Germany, the UK, and the US, among other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>The Chocolate Master/Der Pralinenmeister</em>, by Hans Haacke and published by Art Metropole in 1982, is an artist&rsquo;s book that parallels the artist&rsquo;s unique work, <em>Der Pralinenmeister</em>, produced in 1981. Within this publication, Haacke deconstructs Ludwig&rsquo;s chocolate empire: Ludwig&rsquo;s use of low wage immigrant labor; his use of tax breaks and interest free loans to expand his businesses while driving labor costs down and his income up; as well as Ludwig&rsquo;s use of his collection as a means of garnering governmental [taxpayer] support to service his collection while it was on permanent loan in the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">The juxtaposed presentation of these two publications not only reflects on the economics and politics of the 1960s and &lsquo;70s but also on our contemporary moment. While Peter Ludwig died in 1996, his style of business acumen and collecting has become increasingly common among an acquisitive class of financiers all over the world. This model of public/private partnership in arts institutions is highly developed in the West, but in India it is a nascent form, hampered by unfavorable tax laws for arts philanthropists. This may soon change, as cultural policies are altered to accom-modate and spur the civic-minded private museums that are clearly on the rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><em>&ldquo;The role of the private art collector is well known. To a large degree the public museums are the beneficiaries and heirs of the private collector. Nowhere is his role more important than for contemporary art. Whatever the qualifications of those making decisions for public collections, imbedded as they are in the rules of bureaucratic order; the private collector can acquire today what the majority will understand in years hence.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Peter Ludwig,&nbsp;<em>Kunst der Sechziger Jahre im Sammlung Ludwig im Wallraf-&nbsp;Richartz Museum K&ouml;ln/ Art of the Sixties, Wallraf-Richartz Museum K&ouml;ln,&nbsp;1969, pp. 23-24.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><em>&ldquo;The German chocolate manufacturer and art collector Peter Ludwig once said: &lsquo;The market for Pop Art has been determined by the activities of Mr. and Mrs. Ludwig.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Hans Haacke,&nbsp;</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Hans Haacke: For Real, Works 1959‑2006</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">, Richter Verlag,&nbsp;&nbsp;D&uuml;sseldorf, 2006, pp. 154-157.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Note: This exhibition was first presented at Specific Object in New York in the spring of 2011.&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'exhibition', '983318596-15_10_2015_23_16_39-1444931199.jpg', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '265434176-03_11_2015_14_11_53-1446540113.jpg', '', '', '961307456-03_11_2015_14_11_53-1446540113.jpg', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 5, 4, '', '1', 'published', '2015-10-15 23:16:39', '2015-11-03 14:14:11'),
(36, 1, 'CAUTION: CHILDREN AT WORK', ' ', '<p>Curated by Gitanjali Dang</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EVERY HUMAN BEING IS AN ARTIST. Mistakenly attributed to Joseph Beuys, the idea was first uttered by the eighteenth century German philosopher Novalis. Since, however, this supremely utopian declaration has been reiterated variously by among others, Ananda Coomaraswamy, a pioneering scholar of Indian art, Marxists and the Russian avant-garde.&nbsp;</p>', '<p>Be that as it may, it was Beuys who popularised the idea, eventually transforming it into a maxim. In <em>I Am Searching for Field Character</em>, 1973, a brief statement of intent as it were, the polarising German artist and pedagogue places the utopian declaration front and centre, supporting it with his thoughts on social sculpture. He proposes that creative individuals/artists should take charge of the construction of the &lsquo;social organism as a work of art.&rsquo; In this way, he asserts, the social order of the future can become&mdash;if such a frighteningly lofty ideal were ever possible&mdash;a <em>gesamtkunstwerk</em> or a total work of art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In letting the idea breathe and attempting to tease new meaning from it, one hopes to pull it out of the generational bed to which it has been committed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent essay &quot;The Weak Universalism,&quot;<sup>1</sup> theorist Boris Groys playfully points out that if the world turned into the art world, in which every human being had to produce artworks and compete for the chance to exhibit them at the next hot ticket event, it would be a complete nightmare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every human being is an artist; it&rsquo;s the sort of thought we should hold on to, not for reasons of romance but just to ensure that we don&rsquo;t find ourselves constantly clutching at straws. In the absence of the thought, momentum and efforts would be doomed; there simply would be no reason to try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">In related news, one ought not to hold on to the grand and problematic narrative of the&nbsp;<em>gesamtkunstwerk</em>. Pursued doggedly by Beuys, such a total and idealised artwork can only be synonymous with the spectacle. Instead it might be worth our while to employ our fragmented and transient epoch for leverage. Taking a hint from Duchamp and Beuys we should keep widening the definition of art by pushing for inclusiveness, interdisciplinarity, and newer creative impulses; nothing pathbreakingly alternative, just a generous parallel to the unshakable institutional practice. In doing so we will hopefully encounter an expanded territory that will pose as an antidote to our current spectacle- and icon- mongering ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">This exhibition comprises two broad sections. The one has participant artists contemplating the merits, if any, of the much-bandied maxim with which this essay opens. The other involved a series of loosely structured workshops where the elasticity of creativity was discussed with a group of four neighbourhood children. Activities were devised to make the process more engaging for the children and these activities eventually evolved into two videos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Having said all of the above, it is only fair and prudent to point out that&nbsp;<em>Caution: Children at Work</em>&nbsp;is anchored in a non-profit arts space.

The artist and curator will apply together with a joint-project. While the strength of individual portfolios will be taken into account, our interest is primarily in what you will do in coming together and how that is informed by, while simultaneously departing from, what you could do, as artist or curator, on your own. This will typically require an awareness of what you bring to the table by way of your own practices and preoccupations, as well as an understanding of each other&rsquo;s work. Beyond this, we also encourage you to consider the productive possibilities embedded in knowing that what both of you want out of the process might in fact differ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In preparing to work together, we ask that you re-assess, amongst yourselves, the terms implicit in the artist-curator contract. What do you expect from each other? What function do you feel you ought to perform? To whom are you responsible? To what are you committed? Why? If it were up to you, would you redefine the rules of engagement between the figure of the artist and the role of the curator? How would this redefinition expand the notion of exhibition-making? What implications would that have, if any, for the question of authorship? (We do not expect you to answer these questions directly. Deem them prompts for you to play with and allow them to inspire the shared ground of your thinking.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In your proposal, we want you to tell us what you will do and how you plan to go about doing it. It is important, wherever possible, that you indicate what labour will be shared and also how labour will be divided. (Intellectual labour, like of writing, included.) You may choose, for example, to work more or less independently towards your own objectives, acknowledging that what binds you together, as artist and curator, is simply the space and time of the exhibition. We are open to all forms of artistic and curatorial practice from within the contemporary art context, and are ultimately concerned with what can happen at the place where your trajectories intersect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE SELECTED ARTIST AND CURATOR WILL RECEIVE:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:18.0pt;\">- A 6-8 week exhibition at Mumbai Art Room</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:18.0pt;\">- An artist fee and a curator fee of INR 10,000 each</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:18.0pt;\">- An exhibition budget of up to INR 70,000</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mumbai Art Room will provide critical engagement towards the conceptual development of the project and logistical support towards the production of the exhibition.

The past exhibition, titled&nbsp;<em>The Artists&rsquo; Word</em>, was curated by the late art historian Dr. Veena Shekar and took place in Bengaluru in 2009 when Aishwaryan was still a student. It explored the relationship between word and image on different levels and featured the works of thirty artists. While Shekar&rsquo;s exhibition may not have been a landmark in art history, it was a milestone in Aishwaryan&rsquo;s development as an artist. It played an important role in shaping his understanding of the world, a world inhabited by other artists, curators and designers, as well as by ideas and art works.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing on the experience of a group show that has morphed over time in the mind of the artist, the exhibition considers curatorial practice as a kind of &lsquo;durational endeavour&rsquo; that has the capacity to continuously unfold, and unfold variously, in both physical and mental spaces. <em>The Artist&rsquo;s World</em> begins by reconstructing the 2009 show, adding and removing figures from the narrative. Memory is explored and produced on at least two levels here: the memory of a curator who was also the artist&rsquo;s teacher, and the memory of an exhibition that the artist wanted to participate in. As much an archivist as an artist, Aishwaryan is constantly collecting and cataloguing images and anecdotes of artists and artworks, and the works in the upcoming exhibition are an extension of a practice that self-consciously refers to the works of other artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2009, a number of alternate art spaces had been established in the city of Bengaluru, and the title of Shekar&rsquo;s show, <em>The Artists&rsquo; Word</em>, seemed to hint at a shift that was taking place in both discourse and practice. The word, which had thus far possessed a certain external authority in understanding the image within the tradition of &lsquo;art criticism&rsquo;, was now entering the work itself, either as a kind of silence or as a kind of frame. The difference in these approaches towards the word is often equated to the gap between &lsquo;conventional&rsquo; and &lsquo;conceptual&rsquo; art, and paying attention to what happens in the interstices enables an understanding of a great plurality of languages and mediums that were straddled, appropriated and assimilated. In revisiting this moment, we come together to contextualise a local art history, and in so doing propose a set of relations to a range of art historical categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every word is a palimpsest which bears within it memories of its usage over a period of time. Art works too, speaking to us differently at different moments, have polyphonic voices. The multiple personas that an image and a word might have form the starting point of our collaboration. The project seeks to understand the process of an artist&rsquo;s world making, the role of other artists and curators in this process and how an archive changes not just physically but also emotionally over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\">&ndash; Vaishnavi Ramanathan</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><u>About the artist</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Trained in painting and printmaking, Aishwaryan K.

In moving from the historic neighbourhood of Chitpur, Kolkata to an art space in Colaba, Mumbai, the artists of Hamdasti have been digging through bags and boxes collected over three years of work, contemplating what they have to leave behind. Without the people and the places that made the project possible, without a local audience and its familiarity with local history, what remains could appear as if it were merely a self-referential archive of redundant objects. As they pack and repack the 15kg suitcase, they are confronted with an inevitable question: do social art projects have any agency or relevance beyond the context to which they are committed?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition&nbsp;acknowledges this loss, and a practice, now shifted from its site, undergoes a transformative process of reflection, abstraction, and re-appropriation. A series of seven discrete objects brought into the gallery relinquish and regain specificity. Some were found and carry deep history; some are propositions that were designed with the community as catalysts for conversations; the works invite the viewer to interact and this is how they accrue significance. As traces of these lived experiences and collaborative experiments take form, Chitpur Local brings distanced realities into a shared narrative through its own displacement in Bombay. If the display of art is a call for engagement, then this exhibition gestures to the gallery as a space for intersubjective negotiations. And, through a programme of events, activates a forum for the production of new meanings.&nbsp;</p>', '<p><u>Upcoming programme of events</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 16 to 23 June 2016, Hamdasti will host a series of events themed around questions of social art practice. Conceived in collaboration with Surfatial, CONA Foundation, BIND Collective, Bombay Underground, and others, the programme will take place in and around the neighbourhood of Mumbai Art Room, as well as in different parts of the city.&nbsp; More information coming soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u>About Chitpur Local </u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chitpur Local is an ongoing project by Hamdasti, a Kolkata based collective of artists, which has been developed collaboratively with the people living in Battola (or Jatrapara) on Chitpur Road, one of Kolkata&rsquo;s oldest roads and the main artery of the colonial &ldquo;Black Town&rdquo;. Initiated in November 2013, it explores the role of art in re-activating histories of cultural production. The neighbourhood was a hub of popular traditions such as Jatra (or travelling theatre), printmaking, publishing, jewellery-making and bamboo crafts. The locality also has a legacy of shared spaces &ndash; private courtyards, bookshops and rowaks (or public street corner platforms).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project brought together artists, students, teachers, residents and shop-owners.&nbsp; The participants developed a pop-up museum in a courtyard, a public card game that triggered memories of forgotten narratives, and story boxes for a publishing house. These experiments culminated in a public art festival in in March 2015, deepening community networks and forging new possibilities for the future of the locale.&nbsp;The project was supported by the India Foundation for the Arts between January and June 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hamdasti continues to explore social art practices as they prepare for the next phase of Chitpur Local.

We would like to thank Bombay Underground, BIND and CASP for their participation in the Artist Roundtable, Rohit Goel of Jnanapravaha and the students of his Hungry Art workshop, CONA Foundation, R and R and Dharavi Art Room for opening their doors to Hamdasti for site visits, Surfatial for the Locational Studies study group, and everyone from the public who has been a part of these events.</p>', '<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>', 'N', 'event', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 4, 1, '<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">EXHIBITION<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://http://www.mumbaiartroom.org/projects.php?id=50\">Chitpur (dis)Local</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">EVENT<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mumbaiartroom.org/projects.php?id=51\">Hungry Art&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><a href=\"http://www.mumbaiartroom.org/projects.php?id=54\">Locational Studies</a></p>', '9', 'published', '2016-07-25 12:25:47', '2016-07-25 14:12:43'),

A dead language is therefore not one in oblivion. With that said, what is the act of speaking dead? What world of images can be generated when speaking dead, that is when the speaker is in a state of extreme generosity and unconcerned with how this speaking is received and appropriated by so-called living languages?

Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?&rdquo; The players run in and out of a digital video and a 8mm film, shown alongside each other, offering an understated and joyful display of resistance.

It was first shown at the Greek Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2013, and it is now exhibited for the first time in India. The installation comprises a three-part video and an archive of objects dealing with ideas of money, currency and the generation of value. In its current iteration in Mumbai, in the post-demonetization context, the artist&rsquo;s work investigates the sociality of money &ndash; after all, banknotes are minted on a promise &ndash; a promise which on the midnight of November 8th, 2016 was unceremoniously broken, like so many promises of better days. It connects that particular midnight moment with that of the ongoing Greek economic crisis, which many saw as the shattering of the promise of a unified European Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', '<p>The artist has created an archive of alternative currency systems from around the world, across historical periods. This archive examines social formations from within which particular modes of exchange based on non-monetary systems of value, as well as alternative uses of currency, emerge. This includes currency- systems involving the transfer of talk-time minutes instead of cash in parts of Africa, as well as the use fake currency created as part of an anti-corruption campaign by an NGO in Chennai, where each seemingly-real notes actually contained anti-bribery messages.&nbsp;The objects on display from the archive have been produced in Batikuling wood by craftsmen at the Bellas Artes Projects, the Philippines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three-channel video follows an African immigrant in Athens, who searches for and sells scrap metal for cash; an artist who roams the city, taking photographs on his iPad; and an art-collecter, suffering from dementia, who obsessively creates origami flowers out of euro bank-notes.

We are inviting project proposals that comprise a collaboration between an artist and a curator to be realised in the form of an exhibition. The artist and the curator will apply together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the strength of individual portfolios will be taken into account, our interest is primarily in what you will do in coming together and how that is informed by, while simultaneously departing from, what you could do, as artist or curator, on your own. This will typically require an awareness of what you bring to the table by way of your own practices and preoccupations, as well as an understanding of each other’s work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In preparing to work together, we ask that you re-assess, amongst yourselves, the terms implicit in the artist-curator contract. What do you expect from each other? What function do you feel you ought to perform? To whom are you responsible? To what are you committed? Why? If it were up to you, would you redefine the rules of engagement between the figure of the artist and the role of the curator? How would this redefinition expand the notion of exhibition-making? What implications would that have, if any, for the question of authorship? (We do not expect you to answer these questions directly. Deem them prompts for you to play with and allow them to inspire the shared ground of your thinking.<br />\r\nIn your proposal, we want you to tell us what you will do and how you plan to go about doing it. It is important, wherever possible, that you indicate what labour will be shared and also how labour will be divided. (Intellectual labour, like of writing, included.) You may choose, for example, to work more or less independently towards your own objectives, acknowledging that what binds you together, as artist and curator, is simply the space and time of the exhibition.

But what if at the heart of finance, we found a logic of active offering?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Inter-Species Token Game is a playful experiment about self-issuance and social liquidity production. It responds to the question raised by the Occupy Wall Street movement, following the 2008 financial crash &ndash; which triggered an ongoing global crisis &ndash; &ldquo;How do you occupy an abstraction?&rdquo; The game takes finance as an expressive medium, as a way of foregrounding the social logic of the derivatives and appropriating the tools of finance to explore, and propose, forms of entanglement between human and non-human actors. The game and the accompanying workshops that will take place throughout August seek to re-invent finance as a collaborative practice of crafting futures and re-thinking value at the end of the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Inter-Species Token Game is a game-based artwork, proposed by the Econautic Consultancy and Economic Space Agency.

The Econautic Consultancy is an emergent practice dedicated to thinking artistically and politically at the end of the economy.

It attempts to become a bridge between the vernacular and the sophisticated - thus highlighting the art district of Mumbai. The thought of CONA germinated from a shared studio situation. It is set up with an aim to create an *Adda* situation - which acts as a parallel pedagogic system - to dissolve the hierarchies of art and design, and open up the possibility for cross-pollination. Their curatorial projects like Bartered Collections, Other&#39;s Other and Escape in a Diorama have grappled with the practices of translation, market systems, exhibition design, archive and the politics of collection. As a part of its programming, CONA has initiated an in house print-studio and a Design Cell to look into the praxis of art and design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Maker&#39;s Asylum&nbsp;</strong>FabLab&nbsp;is&nbsp;a community MakerSpace based in Mumbai and Delhi that allows collaborative ideation.

These new forms emerged as a combination of different architectural styles improvised by local architects and craftsman to suit Mumbai&rsquo;s climate, resources and sensibilities.

Through the minimal use of line, she introduces reconfigured columns within the gallery that create an architectural and spatial experience animated by the viewer&rsquo;s movement. By amalgamating ornamental fragments from Mumbai&#39;s rich heritage architecture and incorporating facets of well-known structures in one composition, Ayesha re-imagines them through new perspectives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reha Sodhi</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reha Sodhi is a curator and graphic designer based in New Delhi, India.

How formed or deformed are the digits and palms of our hands?

Ceramic has long accompanied humankind in the history of technology, as from antique craft and means of construction to being a component of industrial engineering, it joined the most sophisticated equipment that compose our mobile devices. Even as the artist acknowledges this, her corporeal engagement with the material to shape the ceramic tools allows her to imprint her digits and trace her own experience.</p>\r\n<p>Bound but not restricted to this particular medium, with the sensitive materiality and movement that her work implies, she opens her practice up to other roles and media such as photography, performance or video. She moves through the numerous boundaries of geographical and political spaces, through those of gender and culture, to lay across them, to connect and open a dialogue within disciplines on materiality and the body. <em>Pinch your Thumb and Three Fingers</em> is a sensitive and intimate contact zone in which Neha Kudchadkar fleshes out the portrait of our human condition; an exhibition on connectivity.</p>\r\n<p>- Text by Marie DuPasquier</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Neha Kudchadkar</strong></p>  \r\n<p> Kudchadkar is a visual and performing artist currently based in Mumbai.

In either case, <em>Apple in Dream Mode</em> invokes this non-human entity’s right to dream, in its somnolence, in its equality with the dreaming human as a political subject. </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conceptual framework of this curatorial proposal has been developed in conversation with the artists Mochu, Suvani, Sonam and Gagan and takes the shape of sound installations, site specific drawings, video and interactive works. A parallel can be drawn between ‘dreaming as political act in neoliberalism’ and curatorial transparency as an antidote to indeterminacy in the cultural economy of contemporary art. <em>Apple in Dream Mode</em> is an attempt to integrate dreaming and curating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<div> </div>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>', '<p><strong>John Xaviers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p> John Xaviers is a Delhi based artist-curator-educator.

Triggered by questions unearthed by the #MeToo movement, Fondle / चिकट is an experimental space for delving into the complexities around consent and body rights. Within the playground, we encounter several of Delhi-based artist Murari Jha\'s hybrid creatures. Inspired by both Dada readymades and Surrealist erotic objects, these sculptural forms cheekily combine allusions to the body\'s erogenous zones with everyday materialities of the South-Asian region. Playing with position, scale, weight, material, movement and other interventions, Jha imbibes into each of his creatures a set of preferences of interaction, often hidden and imperceptible until a labour of understanding is undertaken.\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding to the playground, illustrator Devarshi Gohil, and NGOs Anubhuti Trust and Rubabroo Foundation perform interventions to enrich our understanding of the subject and translate the space to larger audiences.

A Wild Ride Through Land Use, Politics, and Art in the Changing West (The New Press, 2014) </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This exhibition starts, and to a certain degree ends, with Lucy Lippard’s 2014 book Undermining: A Wild Ride Through Land Use, Politics, and Art in the Changing West. Lippard’s writing points to an important aspect of Tanya Busse’s work: the connectedness of local landscape and global crisis. The Norwegian artist prompts us to reflect on the unbalanced relationship of humans with nature, and gestures towards the possibility of a more holistic view of the world, characteristic of indigenous thinking: to cut a tree means to plant a tree, so the cycle of life in nature is not interrupted. </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the center of the exhibition is Tanya Busse’s eponymous video, The Poet’s Antidote. It takes its cue from an ongoing conversation between the artist and a “noaidi”, a poet and shaman of the Sami people, the indigenous people of Scandinavia. Together, they attempt to imagine a spell that would destroy the “war machine”. The work attempts to confront a military industrial complex, placed inside a mountain, through spiritual means. As an act of resistance, the female noaidi does not cast the spell. She does, however, offer a ritual of protection, and in that sense a cure for the deceased mountain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> Tanya Busse presents a distinctively “Northern” perspective in the geopolitical context of the South and the Mumbai region. One way to read her work is against the backdrop of the Arctic, Cold War fears, and the antagonism of capitalistic and indigenous worldviews. At the same time, her work transcends local context and addresses universalistic issues, embodied by the artist’s deep concern with historical narrative, warfare and an ever-changing global political landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> This curatorial lab and exhibition is supported by OCA - Office for Contemporary Art Network</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<div> </div>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>', '<p><strong>Tanya Busse</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p> Tanya Busse (born 1982, lives and works in Tromsø, Norway) is a visual artist working across the mediums of moving-image, sculpture and printed matter.

As such it connotes the imagery of our planet as a mutating terrarium, or at the very least, a closed system within which life is mutating in perceptible and imperceptible ways. Seen against the backdrop of the Sixth extinction or Anthropocene extinction, where we stand to lose up to 50% – 95% of our biodiversity, the darkly glowing orb that is our planet appears to be in a state of suspended animation. In all probability, life would, as it has before, find a way in spite of human intervention, but the critical question is would it be life as we know it? Can we get used to the new way of living and would this living be so much living as languishing? Would there be a ‘we’ to pose that question from? Both dystopian and cautionary in intent, the project proffers alternative pathways, non-linear models of growth that are tentacular and symbiotic, as derived from fellow critters who predate our existence on the planet and profess better promise of riding out the ecological turbulence ahead. </p>\r\n\r\n<div> </div>\r\n\r\n<p>What unites the artists in this exhibition is their interdisciplinary research-driven approach at extrapolating more-than-human evolutionary strands – be it of whales, dolphins, lizards or strangler figs – that nonetheless convey the weight of human-wrought devastation as well as the urgency of holistic, de-centred environmental action and policy making. </p>\r\n\r\n<div> </div>  \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This Curatorial Lab and exhibition has been supported by Inlaks India Foundation, RRO and Kamalnayan Bajaj Art Gallery and Hall</p>\r\n\r\n<div> </div>', '<p><strong>Adwait Singh</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Adwait Singh is an independent curator and theorist based out of New Delhi.
